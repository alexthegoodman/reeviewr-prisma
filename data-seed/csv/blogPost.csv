12681,1,"blogPost","publish","The Story Behind The Name","the-story-behind-the-name","","First off, Hi. My name is Alex Woodman, and I'm the creator/founder of this site.

Reeviewr has been a long road for me personally and hopefully a long one ahead. I've put my blood, sweat, and you-know-what into perfecting this product... and it's still far from perfect. But being an artist myself, I knew that something like this needed to exist, so I set out to make it happen.

More on all of that later.

When I first built Reeviewr, it was called ToxicRobin. I had thought that ToxicRobin would be memorable and edgy- like a band name. Plus I really enjoyed the bird, so I figured whatever I'll just roll with it. I quickly had to come to terms with what was lingering on the back of my mind though, that I don't want a band name. I want a company name.

Reeviewr does a million good things. It encompasses the entire vision for reviews on all sorts of content such as video and writing, it's arguably even more memorable than ToxicRobin, it really represents what it is- and it's the type of name that you'd want to work for. No one wants to sit at the table on Thanksgiving and explain that they've got a new job at ToxicRobin... but Reeviewr? That's impressive.

I've strived to build a simple, beautiful, and rich user experience on Reeviewr, and I hope that you see that shine through the name as well. Serving artists is my #1 goal, and I'm going to be doing everything I can to satisfy you. Please, take a moment to contact me, and let's get to know each other.

14082,1,"blogPost","publish","Finding Your Audience","finding-your-audience","","Hey, Alex here. As an artist myself- rap, hip hop- I've long been curious where to send my music. Who's most likely to enjoy it, share it around, and save it in a playlist?

Here's what I mean, imagine that you're an EDM artist trying to get the word out. Should you be going to electronic fans, people in the dance scene- or should you find out if your true audience are rappers looking for beats?

Hip hop is constantly evolving, and if you listen to people like Waldo (<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/waldoago\">https://soundcloud.com/waldoago</a>), then maybe you can see where non-traditional producers could fit in. Perhaps, you have no interest in working with rap artists, so you change your sound. You find a new horizon... Change can be very good, remember.

Of course, this article wouldn't be complete if I didn't remind you how you might find your audience. If you buy music reviews on ToxicRobin- ask a few specific questions but don't target a demographic. Compare the results of different genres and see if you might want to start going after a new audience.

ToxicRobin is the #1 solution for artists searching for music feedback. We've got custom questions, promotional features, and interactive reports.

15559,1,"blogPost","publish","Reaching Fans In Your Demographic","reaching-fans-in-your-demographic","","We've all been there. You've taken forever to craft the perfect track amidst the trouble and bother of the world. Carefully, you chose each word. Steadily, you dictated your own truth. With love, a tune was found, and beauty was imminent.

That, sir, is no hyperbole. Oh no! That is the story of any fine <em>craftsman. </em>Music is a great art, but it's also a love story. But like so many stories, yours is tragic.

Coworker: \"I'm not much of a country fan, but sure I'll listen\"

4 days later

You: \"Hey, ya get a chance to check out that song?\"

Coworker: \"Oh sorry man, I've been so busy! Play it in the break room?\"

**listen to a twangy, folky track that could use some energy improvements, professional mastering, and a banjo would go great too**

Coworker: \"Oh yeah, not bad. Good job. Keep it up, man. You've got talent.\"</blockquote>
&nbsp;

Why. Why. Why.

I'll tell you why. They don't want to hurt your feelings, they don't like that genre of music, and <em>you</em> didn't craft it for <em>their</em> ears. You put your heart into something that you want millions of female country fans under the age of 28 to listen to. Not some male metal fan entering his mid-life crisis. Sometimes getting good reviews on our music from people we know simply won't work because they aren't in our target demographic. Let's be honest, even if they were capable of giving a genuine, constructive critique of your music, you'd still have doubts because it's only one individual.

The key to reaching fans in your demographic is by getting at least 50 reviews from listeners in that exact group. You'll find out what the <em>right </em>people think, and you'll see the trends. Maybe 5 people say it needs x, but 30 people say it needs y. It's also important to gain real promotion from these people because if they're the fans you want, then they're the fans who'll keep coming back. Try <a href=\"https://reeviewr.localhost.com/how-it-works/\">getting some reviews</a> right here on ToxicRobin after <a href=\"https://reeviewr.localhost.com/explore/\">taking a look at some other tracks</a> artists have uploaded.

Finally there's a proper way for musicians to get the feedback they so desire, and from the group that matters most.

16418,1,"blogPost","publish","Growing Your Network With Other Talented Artists","growing-your-network-with-other-talented-artists","","To be successful in the music industry, and almost anything else, you'll need to remain focused on two things.
<ol>
	<li>Product</li>
	<li>People</li>
</ol>
This can be applied to business, law, web design, and nearly all other important sectors. As a web designer, you must be able to produce aesthetically pleasing and highly functional websites, but you've also got to have a wide, strong network of people who are willing to pay you or recommend you to others. As a businessman, things are very similar- being able to construct a great product and secure a patent is great, but having that foundation of people is what gets you selling.

Artists need to bring themselves into this same mindset if they want to see crowds grow from 10, to 100, to 1,000.

You may very well have come to Reeviewr in hopes of getting thought-provoking, constructive reviews on your music, so that you can apply the newfound understanding before putting the final version on your upcoming album. That's fantastic for your product- your album. It's also an awesome idea. But Reeviewr offers you something much different as well, a way to grow your network of people.

Having a portion of the sites music available on the Explore page allows you the chance to meet other artists who are essentially looking for exactly what you're looking for, which means this is prime time to be picking fruit. You can reach out to these people, ask them what they're doing, and build a strong relationship. You can share each others music around, give each other advice, and I've even seen artists who live in the same state organize gigs together.

You can't forget that your product needs to be coupled with the right people to succeed. It doesn't matter how many hours you bang the drums and hit up the studio because at the end of the day, your network needs to support you. The last thing you want to be caught doing is releasing your demo or mixtape that took months to craft, only to see it quickly become a memory.

Reach out. Take a leap of faith. It's worth it.",0,"","2015-07-02 19:48:24","2017-08-12 02:46:43"
16864,1,"blogPost","publish","The Evolution of Reeviewr","the-evolution-of-reeviewr","","Reeviewr has been a long road, and as I've said before, hopefully a long one ahead!

It started out as a site where artists could come to purchase hundreds of reviews on their music. You could target your demographic by age, gender, favorite genre, and even whether or not they're fans of explicit music. You could choose anywhere from 10 to 300 listeners, and they'd start reviewing within minutes! The vast majority of the listeners were from a 3rd party called <a href=\"https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome\">Amazon MechanicalTurk</a>, where thousands of people are waiting to do small tasks for micro-payments. MechanicalTurk itself doesn't offer any music related options, and it's generally lacking in the feature and design department. Reeviewr bridged the gap in an affordable, good-looking, and feature-rich way.

Through marketing the service and talking with artists- along with many other lessons- I discovered that artists want feedback... but they don't want to pay for it. At least, not just yet! I was never in it for the money, but the MechanicalTurk listeners needed their pay on each song.

Now, Reeviewr is based on a point system. Review 10 tracks to earn 10 points, then you can upload a track for 10 points and it's guaranteed at least 10 reviews! 1 point for 1 review. It's that simple. If you'd like to buy 10 points for $3, that's also an option.

I'll be constantly updating and improving the site. For example, right now you can follow artists, but soon you'll be able to message them also.
